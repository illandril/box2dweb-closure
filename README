Original Box2D created by Erin Catto
http://www.gphysics.com
http://box2d.org/

Box2D was converted to Flash by Boris the Brave, Matt Bush, and John Nesky as Box2DFlash
http://www.box2dflash.org/

Box2DFlash was converted from Flash to Javascript by Uli Hecht as box2Dweb
http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/

box2Dweb was modified to utilize Google Closure, as well as other bug fixes, optimizations, and tweaks by Illandril
https://github.com/illandril/box2dweb-closure

Requires Google Closure: http://code.google.com/closure/


Important changes from Box2DWeb:
 * all userData references have been removed
 * b2Body types are now in b2BodyDef
 * b2Shape types are now in each specific Shape
 * most integer parameters now assume non-null, non-undefined values (like the b2Vec2 and b2Vec3 constructors)
 * b2BodyList and b2FixtureList have been added, instead of each object acting as a node in a linked list
 * b2ContollerEdge has been replaced by b2ControllerList and b2BodyList

Anticipated future changes:
 * b2JointList (similar to b2BodyList and b2FixtureList)
 * b2ContactList (similar to replacement of b2ControllerEdge... maybe)
 * b2ContactID/Features consolidation


Notice anything else that doesn't work (especially if it did work using box2dweb)?
